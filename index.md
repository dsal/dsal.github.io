# Hello, I'm **Ahmad Salehi**
I’m a Remote Sensing Specialist with a strong academic background and hands-on experience in both satellite and in-situ data processing. I have a deep passion for Earth Observation and enjoy working at the intersection of science, technology, and environmental applications.

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, where I focused on electronics and communication systems. I later completed a Master’s degree in Space Sciences and Technologies – Physics for Space Observation.

Over the past years, I’ve gained solid experience working with optical and radar satellite datasets, particularly Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat missions. I also have practical knowledge of in-situ sensors, such as optical and meteorological instruments.

Technically, I am skilled in image processing, computer vision, and machine learning. I work confidently with Python, as well as GIS software like SNAP and Panoply. I’ve also developed and optimized Earth Observation data pipelines, including radiometric calibration, and I’m experienced with cloud-based platforms like Google Earth Engine and AWS.

In my Master’s thesis, I focused on the temporal evolution of two-dimensional spectral reflectance of sea ice during the Arctic summer, using data from hyperspectral sensors and Sentinel-2.

Beyond that, I have worked on a variety of research projects:

Analysis of Landsat-8 imagery in the visible and infrared spectrum using Python.

Monitoring atmospheric NO₂ using a MAX-DOAS instrument.

Ocean optics and time series analysis of NASA's Jason satellite products.

Sea ice concentration and thickness retrieval using passive microwave data.

Radar and optical analysis of sea ice drift using SNAP software.

In my role as a research assistant, I implemented both supervised and unsupervised models—for example, using Random Forest for hyperspectral classification and developing models to detect atmospheric gases and Lambertian reference surfaces. I also contributed to radiative transfer studies and presented scientific results regularly to our research group.
